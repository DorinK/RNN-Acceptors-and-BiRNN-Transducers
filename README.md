# RNN-Acceptors-and-BiRNN-Transducers
Third assignment in Deep Learning course.


This assignment had three parts:

• In part 1, I implemented an RNN acceptor and train it on a specific language.

• In part 2, I explored the capabilities of the RNN acceptor.

• In part 3, I implemented a 2-layer biLSTM tagger with different forms of input representations such as: an embedding vector, character-level LSTM, embeddings + subword representation, a concatenation of embedding vector with character-level LSTM followed by a linear layer.
