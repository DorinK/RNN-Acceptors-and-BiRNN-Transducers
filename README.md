# RNN-Acceptors-and-BiRNN-Transducers
Third assignment in Deep Learning course.


This assignment had three parts:

• In part 1, I implemented an RNN acceptor and train it on a specific language.

• In part 2, I explored the capabilities of the RNN acceptor.

• In part 3, I implemented a bi-LSTM tagger.
